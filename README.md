Exploring Gun Death in the US



Here, I analysed the data on gun related deaths in the US. Data was provided by FiveThirtyEight.com and available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv).

Using the data, I explored gun related death by Month, year, race and sex. I also explored gun related death by the intention i.e whether its homicide or otherwise. Also, I explored the proportion of gun related death for each race in relation to their proportion of the total US Population. Data for US census s contained in census.csv.
